# Abstract

As written by Andrei:
We report here the results of one week long investigation performed during June 2016 USPAS class "Unifying physics..." on conceptual design of an X-ray source based on a compact ring with on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma acceleration injection (mini-project 10.4 from [1]). We describe three versions of the light source, based on 1 GeV normal conducting and supperconducting bending magnets, and 3 GeV superconducting. We describe the design choices, present the tables of parameters of the machines, and describe possible next steps of the design and optimization of the considered machines.

# Introduction
  * Motivation for machine
    * "New scientific capabilities are enabled by laser plasma acceleration..."
    * Compare to examples from the light source community that are ~ same energy, rep rate
    * Comparison to one-pass, betatron-based source
    * Chemical / biological - assays, crystallography
      * Pulse time, rep rate, train length appropriate for these?
  * **Short** discussion of laser plasma acceleration in general + reference to literature review
  * USPAS context

# Machine layout / design
### Design philosophy and misc.
  * Drawing/figure of machine
  * Superconducting vs. normal conducting designs
  * Limiting dimension: energy loss per turn, strength bend and focusing magnets
  * Design of doublet, choice of length for practicality

### Injection chain
### Magnet systems (arcs + doublet + edge focusing)
### Wiggler / light source parameters
### Table of machine parameters
  * Key formulae for a few *vital* parameters in the relevant body text.
  * Shall this be partitioned into a table for each of the sections described above?

# Discussion / future work
  * Estimated light source parameters of this machine
    * Opening angle, spot size?
  * 2nd-gen light source was the "target"
    * Emphasize compact footprint, particularly as technology improves
    * Smaller-scale institution can tackle problem of this scope
  * Bend radiation useful, despite being emitted into large angle?
