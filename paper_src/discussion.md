In this report we propose different design solutions for a compact ring-based X-ray source with an on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma injector. We use four 90 degrees bending magnets to keep the particles on a circular orbit, the electrons are self-injected and accelerated by the plasma wakefield of a gas-jet excited by a 400 TW laser system, and the desired radiation is created by a wiggler magnet. The (peak/average) brilliance is calculated in section xx and reaches up to xx photons/(mm2 mrad2). Even though modern light sources routinely create a/an (peak/average) brilliance in the order of 10^20 photons/(mm2 mrad2 0.1%BW)[ref. z1], this design can be considered attractive due to its compactness and small footprint. Possible Applications include
