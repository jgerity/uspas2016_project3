In this report we propose different design solutions for a compact ring-based X-ray source with an on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma injector. We use four 90 degrees bending magnets to keep the particles on a circular orbit, the electrons are self-injected and accelerated by the plasma wakefield of a gas-jet excited by a 400 TW laser system, and the desired radiation is created by a wiggler magnet. The (peak/average) brilliance is calculated in section xx and reaches up to xx photons/(mm2 mrad2). Even though modern light sources routinely create a/an (peak/average) brilliance in the order of 10^20 photons/(mm2 mrad2 0.1%BW)[ref. z1], this design can be considered attractive due to its compactness and small footprint. Possible Applications include

Input from AAkash on the scattering on residual gas/plasma

Here is an estimation of the Gas flow and beam round-trip based plasma clearance.

Gas Flow velocity from typical gas jets (worked out from [1])
:  M = 20 ~ 20 km / sec
Beam "transit-time" for a 10 m ring
:  ~ 30 ns
Gas flow distance in beam “transit time” 
:  ~ 600 microns
10^14 W/cm^2 ionization thresh. (ASSUME) - plasma col radius (35um laser)
:  142.64 microns  
 
This “back of the envelope calculation” for a 10 m ring with 20 km/sec Gas jet flow velocity [1] suggest that the plasma column has already propagated far enough to eliminate the possibility of its any further interaction with the beam.
So, the electron beam is only likely to interact with the residual gas and not the laser-ionized plasma column.
Thus, the interaction process of the beam is dominated by random scattering off the gas (which leads to a divergence growth of the order of micro-rad) as opposed to a coherent lensing of the order of milli-rad by the plasma [2].
Since, we know that the accelerated beam charge is only 10s of pC and its dimensions about sigma_r = 5um / sigma_z = 10um, it is unlikely that the beam will ionize any gas.
