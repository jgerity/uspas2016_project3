In this report we propose different design solutions for a compact ring-based X-ray source with an on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma injector. We use four 90 degrees bending magnets to keep the particles on a circular orbit, the electrons are self-injected and accelerated by the plasma wakefield of a gas-jet excited by a 400 TW laser system, and the desired radiation is created by a wiggler magnet. The (peak/average) brilliance is calculated in section xx and reaches up to xx photons/(mm2 mrad2). Even though modern light sources routinely create a/an (peak/average) brilliance in the order of 10^20 photons/(mm2 mrad2 0.1%BW)[ref. z1], this design can be considered attractive due to its compactness and small footprint. Possible Applications include

Input from AAkash on the scattering on residual gas/plasma

Here is an estimation of the Gas flow and beam round-trip based plasma clearance.

Gas Flow velocity from typical gas jets (worked out from [1])
:  M = 20 ~ 20 km / sec
Beam "transit-time" for a 10 m ring
:  ~ 30 ns
Gas flow distance in beam “transit time” 
:  ~ 600 microns
10^14 W/cm^2 ionization thresh. (ASSUME) - plasma col radius (35um laser)
:  142.64 microns  
 
This “back of the envelope calculation” for a 10 m ring with 20 km/sec Gas jet flow velocity [1] suggest that the plasma column has already propagated far enough to eliminate the possibility of its any further interaction with the beam.
So, the electron beam is only likely to interact with the residual gas and not the laser-ionized plasma column.
Thus, the interaction process of the beam is dominated by random scattering off the gas (which leads to a divergence growth of the order of micro-rad) as opposed to a coherent lensing of the order of milli-rad by the plasma [2].
Since, we know that the accelerated beam charge is only 10s of pC and its dimensions about sigma_r = 5um / sigma_z = 10um, it is unlikely that the beam will ionize any gas.

 Continuing Work

The design presented is very promising with respect to current compact synchrotron light source technology. There exist designs for laser-plasma produced keV X-ray light sources, with betatron oscillations smaller than 2.5 microns.[1] In addition, a number of proofs-of-concepts have been created.[2][3][4] Furthermore, there exist small synchrotron sources with bending and focusing magnets on the order of 2.7 Tesla which use microtrons as injectors.[5]
There exist many possible uses for the compact high brilliance synchrotron source. Previous work has been done in constructed compact light sources for use in a variety of medical applications, such as emphysema diagnosis [6] and improving CT scanners [7][8]. Another, more exotic use would be for the continually goal of increasing light intensity in the pursuit of reaching the Schwinger limit in order to produce matter-antimatter pairs using extremely high fields. [9]
Future work on the design is needed in order to increase the brilliance of the output synchrotron radiation and to determine the optimum quadrupole aperture sizes. Brilliance is measured in units of  photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW, where BW refers to the bandwidth of the central wavelength or frequency. As a result, increasing the brilliance could be accomplished by increasing the photon flux   (itself accomplished by creating a tighter synchrotron light beam and radiating more photons faster) or by narrowing the range of frequencies in the output. Possible ideas for increasing photon flux include a wider quadrupole aperture to reduce scraping of the electron beam contained within the main ring or combining outputs from multiple electron bunch passes through the undulator. In addition, multiple compact synchrotron light sources have been made that are an order of magnitude smaller in dimensions (fitting on tabletops for example) [10][11], so further work would be put into reducing the synchrotron's radius.
