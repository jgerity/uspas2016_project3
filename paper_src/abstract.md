# Abstract

**As written by Andrei:**

We report here the results of one week long investigation performed during June 2016 USPAS class "Unifying physics..." on conceptual design of an X-ray source based on a compact ring with on-orbit and on-energy laser-plasma acceleration injection (mini-project 10.4 from [1]). We describe three versions of the light source, based on 1 GeV normal conducting and supperconducting bending magnets, and 3 GeV superconducting. We describe the design choices, present the tables of parameters of the machines, and describe possible next steps of the design and optimization of the considered machines.
