Introduction by Jeremy and Andrew
	As laser technology and costs improve, the application to the field of particle acceleration becomes more appealing. 
	Laser acceleration is shown to provide great accelerating potentials in a small region, providing means to create compact 
	accelerator sources. With that in mind, we have taken our first steps in a conceptual design of a compact light source. 
	The goal behind this project was to find initial estimations of parameters for the light source to determine feasibility of 
	the design and show what may be potentially achievable with imminent technology. This project was part of a week-long course 
	at US particle accelerator school under direction of Prof. Andrei Seryi in collaboration with the students of this course. 
	This was a unique and challenging approach to a design that is unique in itself. The focus of the course was to bring together 
	the disciplines of Lasers, particle accelerators and plasma all while considering various inventive principles within the TRIZ
	framework. TRIZ is a method of inventiveness that has one consider the contradictions within the problem to be solved and 
	provide principles used in solutions to these contradictions that have been successful in the past. 
	The design relies on laser plasma acceleration with self-injected electrons. Laser plasma acceleration refers to many 
	mechanisms used for accelerating particles, but for this project we focus on one in particular. High intensity laser 
	pulses are sent to a region filled with a gas. The electrons in the gas are pushed away by the ponderomotive force and 
	separate from the heavier ions. After they separate, the charge of the heavy ions attract the electrons back into the mass 
	creating a plasma wave. This mechanism creates a “bubble” or many “bubbles” of charge separation as the electrons oscillate. 
	As electrons move off of the wave by outrunning it, a phenomenon called “wave breaking” where the electrons are injected into
	the bubble, provides the particles that are to be accelerated [1].
