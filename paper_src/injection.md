A laser wakefield acceleration/injection stage provides the electron beam for the compact ring. In this scheme, an intense laser pulse from a Ti:Sapphire laser impinges on a gas jet.  <TALK ABOUT RECIRCULATION HERE?>

With a given laser power of 379 TW, a laser wavelength of 780 nm, and a pulse duration of 50 fs, and a spot size of 3.8 nm, we obtain a laser intensity of approximately 9.9*1018 W/cm2, a0 of about 2.1 for a Gaussian radial laser distribution, and an energy per pulse of 20 J. The laser spot size and duration were chosen to be typical for this class of laser along with the plasma parameters to ensure that these were matched. The plasma density was chosen to be below the critical density. After calculating the plasma wavelength we ensured that the laser pulse duration was less than the pi/plasma angular frequency.  The depletion and dephasing lengths were calculated to be approximately 17 cm and 35 cm respectively, thus bounding our total possible acceleration length to 17cm. Using our target energies of 1 GeV and 3 GeV, we then calculate how long our acceleration stage needs to be based on a conservative estimate of the magnitude of the gradient in the plasma (0.42 GeV/cm). This results in acceleration stages of 2.4 cm and 7.2 cm respectively. This acceleration length may require a novel gas jet setup, particularly for the 3 GeV case.
