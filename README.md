# USPAS 2016 Unifying Physics - Compact Ring Project

Collaborative repository for the calculation materials and documentation of the design of a compact ring for generating x-ray light, part of [USPAS 2016](uspas.fnal.gov/programs/2016/colorado/index.shtml).

### paper_src/*.md

Individual sections of paper being written by each collaborator.  See [Issues](https://github.com/jgerity/uspas2016_project3/issues) for individual task assignment and discussion.

### uspas_ring.md and paper_notes.md

Working draft of notes on ring design that will be updated as we mature the project and work towards a NA-PAC submission.

### project_3.ipynb

Primary IPython/Jupyter notebook for vital calculations concerning the project.

### parameters.py

Utility script to calculate relevant machine parameters.

You need numpy and scipy installed to run this program.  To get help, simply do

python parameters.py -h

Usage instructions should be printed.
