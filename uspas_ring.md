# Components of the Compact Ring:

**Ring:**
radius to be defined depending on the energy and the magnet technology.

**Focusing Doublet:**
Necessary gradients of the quads depend on beam energy and the divergence. The maximum beam size will influence the aperture and hence the achievable gradient.

**Synchrotron loss per turn:**

is dependent on the beam energy and the radius of curvature in the bending magnets. The wiggler will cause additional energy loss. The characteristic energy emitted also depends on the beam energy and the bending radius.

**Laser/plasma concerns, injection, etc.**

The laser has to be bigger than a0 > 2 in order to have self-injection. The laser wavelength should be chosen in such a way that the dephasing length is lower than we need for acceleration. It also must be ensured that the laser can propagate in the plasma.  The laser depletion has to be longer than the plasma longitudinal size.

The plasma density needs to be chosen so that we can achieve 1 or 3 GeV/c2 within the dephasing length.

## Questions about setup:

* Why use a gas jet rather than a capillary? Doesnâ€™t this produce a larger energy spread?

* Wiggler/undulator?

Andrei's remarks during lecture: better spectral bandwidth with an undulator, so it would be helpful to have this, if our choice of magnet technology makes this feasible.
If the other parameters work out, let's use undulator instead of wiggler, so that we can take advantage of resonance condition.

* Injection spatial profile: what are the clearances like, and regarding the time for the gas to clear, is there a compelling reason that we want to inject in the beamline.
